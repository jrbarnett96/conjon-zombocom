# Movie Scraper -> Dataset collection
General purpose website scraper for data analysis purposes

This program will take data from the Online Movie Database (OMDB) and Box Office Mojo, merging them into a single dataset.

The data from OMDB is categorical data for movies and includes:

Box Office Mojo provides box office financial data for ~800 movies. We combine this financial data with the categorical data
corresponding to each movie.

To use, run main.py in the conjon_zombocom folder. You will be asked to provide a name for your data, and this data will then be
collected and sent to the data/ folder. 

Analysis programs are forthcoming.
